Bug: Inactivity timeout timer always fired -- fixed

Can now import 'stderr' to indicate that stderr output
should be tagged with what stream it came from.

Can now import 'colorize' to color the output based on which
stream it came from.

Can now import 'bail_on_bad_plan' to exit early when a child
exits early.
